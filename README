This project is just a test for CI-Bayes Java library, wich is used to classify 
things based on examples (training).

In this case, i'm using it to classify emails in "bad" (spam) and "good" (no spam).

The bad-email-training uses some spams from SpamAssassin and the good-email-training uses my own good emails.
